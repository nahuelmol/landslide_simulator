### Goals

The main obective are: 
* to develop fluid simulator as aproximation to landslide motion
* to practice gravity anomalies modeling 

### Landslides

I must simulate the flow of a landslide, being as it acts as a fluid due to earthquake-induced liquefaction, and precipitation floods that is retained by the talud which has a that capacity (characteristic of the piroclastic filled area). 

The first approach will be the finite element, discretizing the body of the unstable part of the talud as little pieces where each one moves following motion equations.

And important step is to map the site where the talud fails and above that, represent the motion of that fluid (failed talud). It could be done with simple maps from above.

Other complext aproach for modeling fluids will be considered.

### Gravity anomalies

An additional goal is to put in practice the forward method at modeling gravity anomalies. Then, iterative methods will be take into account to adjust the model like least-squares.
