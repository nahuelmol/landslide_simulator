I must simulate the flow of a landslide, being as it acts as a fluid due to earthquake-induced liquefaction, and precipitation floods that is retained by the talud which has a that capacity (characteristic of the piroclastic filled area). 

The first aproach will be the finite element way, discretizing the body of the unstable part of the talud as little pieces where each one moves following motion equations.

And important step is to map the site where the talud fails and above that, represent the motion of that fluid (failed talud). It coudl with simple maps from above.
